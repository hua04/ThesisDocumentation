            <h5 style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom:5px; margin-left:20px;">  Part 1: Revisit your precedents</h5>

            <h6 style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 5px; bottom:0px;"> 
                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/"> Blade Runner 2049(2017)</a> - A science fiction film about “K”, a “blade runner” (person tasked with tracking down bioengineered humanoids known as replicants and killing them), who uncovers a dangerous secret that threatens to plunge society into chaos.
               <br><br></h6> 
            <listcontent  style = "margin-left: 50px; font-style: normal;">
                - My specific area of interest within this film is "K"’s relationship with Joi, his holographic A.I. girlfriend that provides respite from the stress and frustration within his life.<br>
               - Alongside the psychological implications, I want to look specifically at the way that scenes with Joi, especially at the beginning where she has yet to truly converge with the rest of the issues in his life, are framed and shot for aesthetic inspiration.a<br>
               - There’s also the iconic “you look lonely, I can fix that” scene that feels particularly relevant.<br>
               <br>
            </listcontent>

            <h6 style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 5px; bottom:0px;"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/893850/THE_LONGING/"> The Longing</a> -  A unique idle point and click game where you wait for 400 days in real time for the king to awaken.<br><br></h6> 
            <listcontent  style = "margin-left: 50px; font-style: normal;">
                - What I admire the most about The Longing is the way that the game is able to make the player feel so strongly through the environment, music, and mechanics. It creates this strong sense of melancholy and attachment that starts from the first few minutes and intensifies the more time you spend with the lonely shade as he waits.<br>
               - I want to be able to similarly captivate both the player’s attention and their emotional state through similar aesthetic and mechanical methods, and have these things intensify as the game progresses.<br>
               <br>
            </listcontent>

            <h6 style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 5px; bottom:0px;"><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/how-to-play-dnd "> Dungeons and Dragons</a> -  A fantasy tabletop role-playing game where players create characters and develop them through story based gameplay.<br><br></h6> 
            <listcontent  style = "margin-left: 50px; font-style: normal;">
                - I want to draw inspiration from the structure of stat building combined with narrative to build a character and their path within the world.<br>
               - I’ve seen this system replicated in many other video games that put their own unique twist on it (ie. Monster Prom, I was a Teenage Exocolonist, etc.) to make narrative, sometimes visual novel, style games feel more interactive and customizable. Having certain choices be available based on these stats, or having the outcomes be different depending on the stats, is something I’d like to potentially include in this game, though I acknowledge that building the systems might be too elaborate for this timeframe.<br>
               <br>

            <h6 style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 5px; bottom:0px;"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/"> I was a Teenage Exocolonist</a> -  A role playing game in which you play as a character living in a space colony from ages 10 to 20, building stats and making choices that will affect them, the colony, and the planet around them.<br><br></h6> 
            <listcontent  style = "margin-left: 50px; font-style: normal;">
                - I really like the structure of this game, not only the stat building choice system as mentioned above, but the design as well.<br>
               - Specifically, I like and kind of want to emulate the overworld design of the colony, with specific buildings and places leading to different stats and story beats.<br>
               - I also like the way that relationships between characters are tracked and built, with new details and scenes being unlocked the closer you get to the character.

            <h6 style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 5px; bottom:0px;"><a href="https://robobarbie.itch.io/every-time-you-blink"> EVERY TIME YOU BLINK by Robobarbie</a> -  A Ludum Dare 51 submission that combines a variety of puzzles with time limits with a short narrative.<br><br></h6> 
            <listcontent  style = "margin-left: 50px; font-style: normal;">
                - I admire how this game is able to achieve a cohesive narrative with so little, especially with it being created within a game jam timeframe.<br>
               - I like the concept of using small puzzles and finding ways to connect them to the narrative. The game is about an ambiguous past conflict, and as the characters talk and try to repair their relationship, the words and themes covered in the minigames are related to their conflict revealing more about their relationship as the player progresses.

            <listcontent  style = "margin-left: 50px; font-style: normal;">
               - Kindles empathy or sympathy, builds a connection to the in game characters.<br>
               - Player agency, choices matter.<br>
               - Stress and loneliness juxtaposed with comfort and freedom.<br>
               - Balance and maintenance.<br>
               - Detailed cartoony 2D art.<br>

            <h6 style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 5px; bottom:0px;">Design Questions:<br><br></h6> 
            <listcontent  style = "margin-left: 50px; font-style: normal;">
               - Is there a way to utilize escapism as a coping mechanism in a beneficial manner?<br>
               - What leads people to indulge in escapist fantasies? or What causes people to become attached to fiction?<br>
               - Why is fiction more attractive to some people than reality?<br>
               - Why is loneliness such a prominent issue currently?<br>
               - How do you make games meant to simulate suffering and still make people want to play?<br>
               - How does one make two separate systems of play interact cohesively?<br>
               - How does one combine two different UI aesthetics in a way that feels cohesive and smooth?<br>
               - How does one use a cartoony art style to discuss serious issues of mental health?<br>

            <h5 style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom:5px; margin-left:20px;">  Part 5: Ideas for Interactive Prototype</h5>

            
            <h6 style="text-align: left;  margin-top: 5px; bottom:0px;">Next Prototype:<br><br></h6> 
            <listcontent  style = "margin-left: 50px; font-style: normal;">
                For my next prototype, I am planning on expanding on the last playtest to include the feedback I was given during the last playtest. I will be planning to include more minigames that are math and visual based instead of language and word based, and a more prominent stress bar. I might also try to work on the computer screen UI.
